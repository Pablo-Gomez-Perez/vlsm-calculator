## VLSM Calculator

This project is a Java-based Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM) calculator designed to facilitate IP address allocation in networks of different sizes. Whether dealing with Class A, B, or C networks, this tool helps efficiently distribute IP addresses among subnets to optimize address space usage.

### Features:
- Supports VLSM calculations for Class A, B, and C networks.
- User-friendly interface for easy subnetting and IP address allocation.
- Efficient allocation of IP addresses to subnets of varying sizes.
- Detailed documentation and usage guidelines provided.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java files.
3. Run the application.
4. Input network details and subnet requirements.
5. Obtain calculated results for efficient IP address allocation.
